## 👋 Hello, I'm Jardel Matias a.k.a francoatmega

I'm a dedicated and passionate software engineer, specializing in backend development with a profound interest in information security and hacking. My journey in the tech world began in 2017, but my love for computers started at the age of 15. Since then, I've had the privilege to collaborate with diverse companies, engaging in projects that range from revitalizing legacy monolithic applications to contributing to cutting-edge fintech products. These experiences have not only been challenging but also incredibly rewarding.

💻 I'm a fervent dark theme enthusiast. You'll often find me engrossed in a stack of books during my spare time, continuously expanding my knowledge. Beyond the world of code, I also enjoy hanging out with friends, striking a balance between my passion for technology and the joys of human connections.
